Hi. I'm **Wander Costa**, husband, software developer, and coffee lover.
At present, I'm working as Engineering Manager at FREE NOW.

I was always fascinated by programming since I was a kid. Today, as a
**software developer** and two decades after writing my first
scripts, I work with programming languages and technology to solve
problems of real users. I'm also very interested in performance, distributed
systems, open-source software and code readability.

**Coffee lover?**
Yeah, I coffee lover, black pls. Sometimes I'm trying to make home espressos.
But I wouldn't say I'm always successful with milk foam, though. :grimacing:

**What's WanderCosta.com about?**
I write about any topics, sometimes sharing tips and thoughts; maybe
memes, non-sense, pictures of cats or dogs might also be expected.
