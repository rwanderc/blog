the algorithm.

# Identifying Spikes in Real Time

In real time streams of data, the data needs to be processed while being received, in order to optimize for a quicker
response and identification of the potential spikes. However, for an ongoing spike, the algorithm can read only the
value received or previous data points, comparing to the previous values.

And that's why it's important to keep the focus on the acceleration of the data set, as it will easily show the changes
in the tendency of the data set.

However, how much acceleration change is considered a potential spike or valley spot?

The answer depends on the actual behaviour and tendency of dispersion of the data set. Therefore, it's also important
measure the **Standard Deviation** of the acceleration to define what's acceptable and what's not.

# Spike simulator

In the simulation below (generated by [spike-generator][spike-generator]), there are 5 spikes/valleys. The algorithm
should be able to capture the first while receiving this specific one in the streaming.
