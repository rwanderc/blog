It's been a long time since a last published a post on the blog. **Shame shame shame!**

My last published post was [Your first SpringBoot app in 5 steps][spring-boot-5-steps] on September 2019, 2.5 years ago.
SpringBoot was in its version 2.0.8. Today, SpringBoot is in version 2.6.6.

But why did this happen? The reason is clear:
> laziness!

Kidding! Or better described... partially kidding!
Besides a bit of laziness, many things happened during this time:
- I published Spring MultiRabbit, an open-source library to provide support for multiple RabbitMQ brokers for Spring
  applications
- Had my first talk at a conference
- Contributed part of Spring MultiRabbit to the Spring Framework; but got the 2nd part of the contribution rejected :(
- Moved from Senior Software Engineer to Engineering Manager at FREE NOW
- Faced tough professional challenges and learned a lot from them
- Started a couple of projects, but a special one with a friend

Willing to write more about Software Engineering things.

Stay tuned!
