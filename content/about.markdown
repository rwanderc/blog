Hi. I'm **Wander Costa**, husband, coffee lover on pause,
software engineer by heart, enginering lead by profession. \
Since 2023, working as Engineering Manager at Google.

I was hooked on programming since childhood. Two decades after writing my first scritps, I already coded in Kotlin, Go, C, but Java being my primary language of choice (you can blame me). \
I really enjoy the proces of solving issues, the building of new functionalities, finding spots to improve performance, creating distributed systems using open source tools, making code shine not because it's carefully written but because it impacts someone's life.

As an **engineering lead** since 2020, my work is completely different but still chasing the same outcome of transforming code into impact, however through leading teams. \
My main work is to help engineers succeed delivering reults and growing. That's a much harder goal, but honestly nobody ever told me it would be easier.

# Coffee lover on pause?
Yeah, I'm coffee lover, black pls. \
Spent some time trying to make home made espressos, but I wouldn't say I was very successfullÂ on that. :grimacing: \
Nevertheless I'm on a coffee pause for some time.

# What's WanderCosta.com about?
This is a personal blog written, edited, and maintained by me. \
I share my own opinions and thoughts. \
And I write about any topics, sometimes sharing tips and insights; maybe memes, non-sense, pictures of cats or dogs might also be expected.
