<p>I'm an entrepreneur science-driven software engineer, mainly interested in software development and technology. Currently I work in the Oil & Gas industry, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

<p>My higher experiences relay on Linux, Java (with all the ecosystem behind it) and MySQL. Currently I run a couple of different projects, what makes me busy most of the time, but still hungry for sharing experience.</p>

<p>This is my personal blog where I share my thoughts and ideas.</p>
