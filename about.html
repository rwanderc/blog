<p>Hi. I'm <b>Wander Costa</b>, a programmer, co-founder and coffee lover.</p>

<p>I was fascinated by programming since I was a kid. Today, as a
    professional <b>programmer</b> and two decades after writing my first
    scripts, I work with programming languages and technology to solve real
    problems of real users. I'm also very interested in performance, distributed
    systems, open-source software and code readability.</p>

<p>As <b>co-founder</b> of <b><a href="https://wideping.com">Wideping</a></b>,
    a distributed uptime monitoring service, I help individuals and 
    businesses monitor their assets and make their businesses more reliable.</p>

<p>As a <b>coffee lover</b>, I'm trying to make my home espressos and some
    fancy designs with the milk foam. Not always successful, though. =(</p>

<p>I write about these topics, sharing tips and thoughts I gained throughout
    the years. But some memes, non-sense, pictures of cats or dogs might also
    be expected.</p>
