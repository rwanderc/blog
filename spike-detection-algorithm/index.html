Otherwise, enjoy
the explanation of the mathematical background and the algorithm logic.</p><p><img src=/img/spikes-simulator-sampling.png alt></p><p>Detecting spikes or valleys in discrete series of data is a matter of identifying big variations in the
sequence of points. But how big should be the variation? How fast should it vary?<br>For this we will need two understand some mathematical concepts, which are <strong>instant speed</strong> and
<strong>instant acceleration</strong>. In functions, instant speed and acceleration can be given by the first and
second derivatives, respectively. In discrete series of data, the analog concept can be applied, and
that&rsquo;s what will be discussed in the following sections.</p><h1 id=mathematical-exploration>Mathematical exploration</h1><p>Disclaimer: it&rsquo;s assumed that readers of this post have at least a shallow understanding about mathematical
concepts such as limits & derivatives. This post is not intended to explain them, and if you need to learn
these concepts, there are plenty of free & good content on the internet about Calculus.</p><h2 id=speed>Speed</h2><p>The speed of a curve in a specific point is given by its first derivative, and can ultimately be used to calculate the
angle of the curve in that specific point, i.e. defining the tangent in a specific point.</p><blockquote><p>More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c if the line passes through
the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has slope f&rsquo;(c), where f&rsquo; is the derivative of f.</p></blockquote><p>In the parabola below, described by the function <code>f(x) = x^2</code>, its first derivative function is expressed by <code>f'(x) = 2x</code>.
And from that, it&rsquo;s possible to calculate the exact angle of the curve in any point by the expression <code>g(x) = atan(f'(x))</code>,
in radians, or <code>h(x) = atan(f'(x)) * 180/π</code>, in degrees.</p><p><img src=/img/spikes-xx-2x-angle.png alt></p><p>Looking to the graph of <code>f(x)</code>, it&rsquo;s easy to see where the curve changed its direction. And this is also reflected
in the graph for <code>f'(x)</code>, since that the value transits from negative to positive passing through <code>0</code>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to observe the relation between <code>f(x)</code> and <code>g(x)</code> in the limits: when <code>x</code> tends to <code>-∞</code>, <code>g(x)</code>
tends to <code>-90</code>; and when <code>x</code> tends to <code>+∞</code>, <code>g(x)</code> tends to <code>90</code>, however, <code>g(x)</code> never touches <code>-90</code> or <code>90</code>.
And it&rsquo;s intuitive to read this from <code>f(x)</code>, since having angles of either <code>-90</code> or <code>90</code> would mean <code>f(x)</code> would be a
vertical line, therefore having infinite values for the same <code>x</code>.</p><p>For this work, it&rsquo;s interesting to understand the relation of the first derivative, the angle and the curve, but it
won&rsquo;t be necessary to calculate angles in radians or degrees. Therefore, keep focusing on the derivatives only.</p><h2 id=acceleration>Acceleration</h2><p>The acceleration of a curve can be interpreted as an extension of the concept of the speed, however given by the second
derivative. Therefore, for the function <code>f(x) = x^2</code>, the first derivative is given by the expression <code>f'(x) = 2x</code> while
the second derivative is given by the expression <code>f''(x) = 2</code>, which is a constant. In other words, <code>f(x)</code> has constant
acceleration for every value of <code>x</code>.</p><p><img src=/img/spikes-xx-2x-2.png alt></p><p>An important aspect of the acceleration is directly inferred from its signal: a positive acceleration <code>f''(x)</code> means
that <code>f(x)</code> is concave upwards; a negative acceleration <code>f''(x)</code> means that <code>f(x)</code> is concave downward. An example of
negative acceleration could be given by <code>f(x) = -x^2</code>, where <code>f''(x) = -2</code>. For both examples, however, the acceleration
is constant.</p><blockquote><p>The graph of a function with a positive second derivative is upwardly concave, while the graph of a function with a
negative second derivative curves in the opposite way. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_derivative>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_derivative</a></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/spikes-xx-2x-2-negative.png alt></p><p>Take another example function and its derivatives with a different behaviour: <code>f(x) = x^3 - 15x</code>, <code>f'(x) = 3x^2 - 15</code>
and <code>f''(x) = 6x</code>. From the second graph, it&rsquo;s easy to spot the 2 moments where <code>f'(x) = 0</code>, which is the reflection
of <code>f(x)</code> changing direction from increasing to decreasing or vice-versa, i.e. the speed
reached <code>f'(x) = 0</code> for both <code>x = sqrt(5)</code>
and <code>x = -sqrt(5)</code>.</p><p><img src=/img/spikes-xxx-3x2-6x.png alt></p><p>The graph of the acceleration <code>f''(x)</code> does not provide information about the change of the direction of <code>f(x)</code>.
However, it provides different and important insight: the indication of the change of the curvature of the parabola
described by <code>f(x)</code>. Looking at the graph from <code>f''(x)</code>, it&rsquo;s easy to find where <code>f(x)</code> stopped behaving as a parabola
pointing downward and started behaving as a parabola pointing upward, since the acceleration reached <code>0</code>, coming from
negative to positive. This is then the point of inflection of <code>f(x)</code>: the point where the function <code>f(x)</code> changes
concavity direction.</p><p>For the scope of the algorithm, it&rsquo;s important to understand how to identify:</p><ul><li>Points where the 1st derivative changes signal</li><li>Points of inflection, where the 2nd derivative changes signal</li></ul><h2 id=speed-and-acceleration-in-discrete-series>Speed and Acceleration in discrete series</h2><p>Discrete series of data are discontinuous by definition. Concepts like limits, derivatives, integrals are not applicable.
In fact, discrete series are not even functions, but sets of points. Therefore, the way to calculate speed or acceleration
is to use what would be an approximation of the concepts of derivatives, i.e. a straight line between two neighbor points.
Speed and acceleration have their analog meanings for discrete series considering the same logic.</p><p><img src=/img/spikes-xx-discrete.png alt></p><p><img src=/img/spikes-xxx-discrete.png alt></p><p>The speed of discrete series of data can be calculated as the angle between two points, i.e. the quotient of the
differences between <code>(x0, y0)</code> and <code>(x1, y1)</code>: <code>dY/dX = (y1-y0)/(x1-x0)</code>.</p><p>For a series of data points <code>S1(x,y) = {[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]}</code>, the speed between 1st and 2nd points, and between 2nd and
3rd points equals <code>1</code> (<code>dY/dX = (2-1)/(2-1) = 1</code> and <code>dY/dX = (3-2)/(3-2) = 1</code>). However, for the series of data
points <code>S2(x,y) = {[1,1], [2,2], [3,10]}</code>, the speed between 1st and 2nd points is <code>1</code> (<code>dY/dX = (2-1)/2-1) = 1</code>) while
between 2nd and 3rd is <code>8</code> (<code>dY/dX = (10-2)/(3-2) = 8</code>). Then the series of speeds are
respectively <code>S1'(x,y) = {[1,1], [2,1]}</code> and <code>S2'(x,y) = {[1,1], [2,8]}</code></p><p><img src=/img/spikes-discrete-examples.png alt></p><p>Like the 2nd derivative, the acceleration of the discrete series can be calculated as an extension of the speed, i.e.
the quotient of the differences between two speeds <code>(x'0, y'0)</code> and <code>(x'1, y'1)</code>: <code>d'Y/dX = (y'1-y'0)/(x'1-x'0)</code>.
Therefore, given the previous data sets, the acceleration will be given by <code>S1''(x,y) = {[1,0]}</code>
and <code>S2''(x,y) = {[1, 7]}</code>. That is, the acceleration of S1 is <code>0</code> while the acceleration of S2 is <code>7</code> for the sets
specified.</p><p>With another example <code>S3(x,y) = {[1,1], [2,2], [3,5], [4,14]}</code> however, the acceleration would be given
by <code>S3''(x,y) = {[1,1], [2,8]}</code> which is not a constant anymore. The same concepts and effects of the change of signal
of the &ldquo;first derivative&rdquo; or the point of inflection are applied.</p><h1 id=algorithm-logic>Algorithm logic</h1><p>WIP</p><div class=blog-tags>Tags:
